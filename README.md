# EIDA Yasmine Workshop

During past years, the generalisation of stationXML1.1 format (following SEED dataless retirement) as metadata exchange format of EIDA datacenters and producers has showed the need for an efficient native stationXML metadata edition toolbox.
Résif gathered and generalized the needs from the french community in order to develop a good metadata edition tool wich aims at simplifying the workflows and processes of producing and editing metadata. Introducing Yet Another Stationxml Metadata Editor (Yasmine).

Starting from a first version developped for IRIS-DMC, Résif expanded the functionnalities of yasmine for a fully featured toolbox with a graphical user web interface and a command line utility.

This webinar will present the overall functionality of Yasmine, presented by the project manager Jean-Marie Saurel followed by a discussion about the existing workflows for metadata edition in the european community.
